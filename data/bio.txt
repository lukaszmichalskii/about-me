Lukasz Michalski is a research student at CERN's experimental physics department, contributing to the CMS experiment. His work focuses on real-time and quasi-real-time data acquisition, as well as physics analysis algorithms, with a particular emphasis on jet clustering, tagging, and heterogeneous computing solutions. Previously, he worked at Intel on AI Graphics Software for DirectX 3D and at Nokia, where he developed internal tools for analyzing eNB machine logs and an in-house source code management system for SoC hardware solutions. He holds a BEng in Computer Engineering, and is currently pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology. Beyond his academic and research work, he is an active member of the PWR Racing Team, contributing to the development of electric formula-style race cars with autonomous capabilities. He serves as an Autonomous Systems Engineer for the RT15e and RT14e projects and as a Path Planning Engineer for the RT13e project.
